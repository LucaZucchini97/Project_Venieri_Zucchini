    "Diabetes is a serious disease affecting millions of people across the entire world. Thus, correct and timely prediction of this disease is very important due to the complications it can have in the case of other life-threatening diseases.\n",

    "\n",
    "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females\n",
    "at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  \n",
    "The Pima (or Akimel O'odham, also spelled Akimel Oʼotham, \"River People,\" formerly known as Pima) are a group of Native Americans living in an area consisting of what is now central and southern Arizona, as well as northwestern Mexico in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua.\n",
    "The diversion of the water and the introduction of non-native diet is said to have been the leading contributing factor in the high rate of diabetes among the Akimel Oʼodham tribe. They have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the world, much more than is observed in other U.S. populations.    \n",
    "The general increased diabetes prevalence among Native Americans has been hypothesized as the result of the interaction of genetic predisposition (the thrifty phenotype or thrifty genotype), as suggested by anthropologist Robert Ferrell in 1984[13] and a sudden shift in diet during the last century from traditional agricultural crops to processed foods, together with a decline in physical activity.  \n",
    "Between U.S. Pima indians, 34.2% of men and 40.8% of women suffer from diabetes as reported in https://doi.org/10.2337/dc06-0138."

We know that insulin promotes the storage of sugars triggering the metabolic process called lipogenesis. This process is how our body converts fatty acids and glycerol into fats. This is why high levels of insulin correlate with higher SkinThickness.\n",

    "- **Insulin - Diabetes_2** The same applies for Diabetes_2: it was expected to have high correlation since we selected only the cases of diabetes with not-low insulin level to build the Diabetes_2 column. Moreover, if a patient suffers from type 2 diabetes, her body still breaks down carbohydrate from her food and turns it into glucose. The pancreas then responds to this by releasing insulin. But because this insulin can't work properly, her blood sugar levels keep rising. This means more insulin is released."

    "\n",
    "- **Age - Diabetes_1** and **Age - Diabetes_2**: The risk of developing diabetes increases with age. This risk is present for both types of diabetes with different weight: aging has the effect of increasing insulin resistance and lower the function of insulin-producing cells in pancreas.\n",

For most women with gestational diabetes, the diabetes goes away soon after delivery. When it does not go away, the diabetes is called type 2 diabetes. Even if the diabetes does go away after the baby is born, half of all women who had gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes later.\n",

    "- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction - Diabetes_1** and **DiabetesPedigreeFunction - Diabetes_2**: Both types of diabetes have a genetic predisposition risk factor. The Diabetes Pedigree Function is an index that takes the family history of the patient into account to predict the likelihood of diabetes insurgence.\n",

    "- **Glucose - BloodPressure** : Hyperglycemia can contribute to hypertension. High blood sugar can increase blood pressure through two primary means. First, untreated hyperglycemia can lead to nerve and blood vessel damage. Damage to the blood vessels causes the walls to stiffen, narrow, and accumulate plaque. Plaque buildup narrows the vessels, increasing pressure and contributing to hypertension. Second, chronic hyperglycemia leads to chronic hyperinsulinemia, that we have already seen causes hypertension."
