    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Diabetes is a serious disease affecting millions of people across the entire world. Thus, correct and timely prediction of this disease is very important due to the complications it can have in the case of other life-threatening diseases. Diabetes can be diagnosed through observation of some clinical data, in particular blood glucose level. But if blood glucose level is used to diagnose diabetes, there are other factors (called risk factors) that can suggest, but not confirm, that a patient has diabetes. The latter consideration leads to the development of this project, where we will analyze different clinical data, to understand the impact of certain risk factors on the likelihood of developing diabetes in patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is therefore to apply the studied notions about Bayesian Networks, to implement a probabilistic model on a dataset built from patients with diabetes and to extrapolate the correlations between risk factors and diabetes."

    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n",
    "The Pima (or Akimel O'odham, \"River People\") are a group of Native Americans living in an area consisting of what is now central and southern Arizona, as well as northwestern Mexico in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua.\n",
    "The diversion of the water and the introduction of non-native diet is said to have been the leading contributing factor in the high rate of diabetes among the Akimel OÊ¼odham tribe. They have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the world, much more than is observed in other U.S. populations.    \n",
    "The general increased diabetes prevalence among Native Americans has been hypothesized as the result of the interaction of genetic predisposition and a sudden shift in diet during the last century from traditional agricultural crops to processed foods, together with a decline in physical activity.  \n",
    "Between U.S. Pima indians, 34.2% of men and 40.8% of women suffer from diabetes as reported in https://doi.org/10.2337/dc06-0138."

    "- **Insulin - SkinThickness** : SkinThickness is a measure of how much fat is stored in skin cells. We know that insulin promotes the storage of sugars triggering the metabolic process called lipogenesis. This process is how our body converts fatty acids and glycerol into fats. This is why high levels of insulin correlate with higher SkinThickness. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lipogenesis#:~:text=Insulin%20promotes%20lipogenesis%2C%20thereby%20resulting,Fig.)\n",
    "- **BMI - SkinThickness** : Of course being overweight increses the chance of having more fat in the skin and vice versa.\n",
    "- **Insulin - Diabetes_1** : Having type 1 diabetes means having problems producing insulin. This high negative correlation was expected since we built the Diabetes_1 column filtering for Diabetes cases with low insulin level.\n",
    "- **Insulin - Diabetes_2** The same applies for Diabetes_2: it was expected to have high correlation since we selected only the cases of diabetes with not-low insulin level to build the Diabetes_2 column. Moreover, if a patient suffers from type 2 diabetes, her body still breaks down carbohydrate from her food and turns it into glucose. The pancreas then responds to this by releasing insulin. But because this insulin can't work properly, her blood sugar levels keep rising. This means more insulin is released."

First, untreated hyperglycemia can lead to nerve and blood vessel damage. Damage to the blood vessels causes the walls to stiffen, narrow, and accumulate plaque. Plaque buildup narrows the vessels, increasing pressure and contributing to hypertension. Second, chronic hyperglycemia leads to chronic hyperinsulinemia, that we have already seen causes hypertension.

    "To conclude, the obtained results are in line with the basic knowledge of internal medicine, confirming the validity of the produced work. It is important to emphasize that in the medicine field it is hard to work purely with neural networks, since usually what is required is not a single prediction (classification/regression task) but probabilities associated with each single possible outcome. Of course this could be obtained with neural networks as well, but with them it is impossible to set up all the causal connections between the features. For such reason bayesian network have been useful and powerful in extrapolating the values of correlations between risk factors and diabetes in our analysis."
